# Shopping-list
This is a site for adding items to a receipt and calculating the total price.
On the left side are three input fields and a button for adding items to the receipt.
If a user does not fill out all the input fields an alert will pop up to let the user know that something has not been filled out.
On the right is a container (receipt) where all the added items are stored and a button which calculates the total price in BAM currency.
All the new items appear with a fade-in effect, which was achieved using jQuery.
All of the CSS styles and layout were achieved using bootstrap.
